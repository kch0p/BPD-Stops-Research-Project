# Berkeley PD ISF 110
 
This is the github for a research project analyzing police stops in the city of Berkeley from 2015-2022. This continues the work done by the Center for Policing Equity in [their 2018 report](https://www.berkeleyside.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Berkeley-Report-May-2018.pdf), but focuses on publicly available stops data and incorporates more recent RIPA-Compliant data that's been collected since late 2020. The total dataset (from 2015-now) encompasses approximately 65k stops, and has 10 shared/45 overall features.
